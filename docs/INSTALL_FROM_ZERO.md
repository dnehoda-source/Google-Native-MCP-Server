# 🚀 From GitHub to Cloud Run — The Complete Install Guide

## What You're Building

You're taking code from the internet (GitHub), putting it in a box (Docker container), and running that box on Google's servers (Cloud Run). When you're done, you get a URL. Any AI that knows how to speak MCP can use that URL to search your SIEM, enrich threat intel, isolate endpoints, purge phishing emails, and more.

**Total time:** 20–30 minutes, start to finish.

**Total cost:** Free while idle. ~$5/month with moderate use.

---

## What You Need Before Starting

You need 3 things. If you're missing any of them, follow the instructions below to get them.

### Thing 1: A Google Cloud Account

This is how you pay for Google Cloud services (like Cloud Run).

**Already have one?** Go to https://console.cloud.google.com — if you can log in, you're good. Skip to Thing 2.

**Don't have one?** Here's how to create it:

1. Go to **https://cloud.google.com** in your browser
2. Click **"Get started for free"** (top right)
3. Sign in with your Google account (the same one you use for Gmail)
4. Google gives you **$300 in free credits** for 90 days — more than enough
5. You need to add a credit card, but you **won't be charged** unless you manually upgrade to a paid account
6. Fill out the billing info and click **"Start Free"**

You now have a Google Cloud account.

### Thing 2: A Google Cloud Project

A "project" is like a folder that holds all your cloud resources. Every API, every server, every secret lives inside a project.

**Create one:**

1. Go to **https://console.cloud.google.com**
2. At the very top of the page, you'll see a dropdown next to "Google Cloud" — it might say "Select a project" or show an existing project name
3. Click that dropdown
4. Click **"NEW PROJECT"** (top right of the popup)
5. **Project name:** Type something like `secops-mcp` (lowercase, no spaces)
6. **Organization:** Leave as default (or pick yours if you see one)
7. Click **"CREATE"**
8. Wait 10 seconds. It'll say "Your new project is ready."
9. Click **"SELECT PROJECT"** to switch to it

**Write down your Project ID.** It's shown under the project name (looks like `secops-mcp` or `secops-mcp-123456`). You'll need this later.

### Thing 3: The `gcloud` Command Line Tool

This is the tool that lets you control Google Cloud from your terminal (instead of clicking around the website).

**Check if you already have it:**
```bash
gcloud version
```
If you see version numbers, skip to Step 1. If you see "command not found," install it:

**Mac:**
```bash
brew install google-cloud-sdk
```
Don't have `brew`? Go to https://brew.sh and follow the one-line install, then come back.

**Linux (Ubuntu/Debian):**
```bash
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install -y apt-transport-https ca-certificates gnupg curl

curl https://packages.cloud.google.com/apt/doc/apt-key.gpg | sudo gpg --dearmor -o /usr/share/keyrings/cloud.google.gpg

echo "deb [signed-by=/usr/share/keyrings/cloud.google.gpg] https://packages.cloud.google.com/apt cloud-sdk main" | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/google-cloud-sdk.list

sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install -y google-cloud-cli
```

**Windows:**
1. Go to **https://cloud.google.com/sdk/docs/install#windows**
2. Download the installer
3. Run it. Click Next through everything.
4. At the end, check "Run gcloud init" and click Finish

**Verify it works:**
```bash
gcloud version
```
You should see something like `Google Cloud SDK 470.0.0`. The exact version doesn't matter.

---

## Step 1: Log In to Google Cloud

Open your terminal and run:

```bash
gcloud auth login
```

**What happens:** Your web browser opens automatically. Sign in with the same Google account you used to create the Cloud account. Click **"Allow"** when Google asks for permissions.

Your terminal will say: `You are now logged in as [your-email@gmail.com]`

Now tell gcloud which project to use:

```bash
gcloud config set project YOUR_PROJECT_ID
```

**Replace `YOUR_PROJECT_ID`** with the Project ID you wrote down in Thing 2 (e.g., `secops-mcp`).

**Not sure what your Project ID is?** Run:
```bash
gcloud projects list
```
It shows all your projects. Copy the one you want and use it.

---

## Step 2: Download the Code

You need to get the MCP Server code from GitHub onto your computer. Pick the easiest option for you:

### Option A: Download as ZIP (No Git Required — Easiest)

1. Open your browser
2. Go to: **https://github.com/dnehoda-source/Google-Native-MCP-Server**
3. Look for the big green button that says **"<> Code"**
4. Click it
5. In the dropdown, click **"Download ZIP"**
6. Your browser downloads a file called `Google-Native-MCP-Server-main.zip`
7. Find it in your **Downloads** folder
8. **Unzip it:**
   - **Mac:** Double-click the ZIP file
   - **Windows:** Right-click → "Extract All"
   - **Linux:** `unzip Google-Native-MCP-Server-main.zip`
9. Open your terminal and go to the folder:

```bash
cd ~/Downloads/Google-Native-MCP-Server-main
```

### Option B: Use Git Clone

```bash
cd ~/Desktop
git clone https://github.com/dnehoda-source/Google-Native-MCP-Server.git
cd Google-Native-MCP-Server
```

**Don't have git?** Just use Option A. It's the same code.

---

## Step 3: Turn On the Google Cloud Services

Google Cloud has hundreds of services, but they're all turned off by default. Your MCP server needs 7 of them. Here's what each one does:

| Service | What It Is | Why Your Server Needs It |
|---|---|---|
| **Cloud Run** | Runs your server in the cloud | This is where your MCP server actually lives and runs |
| **Cloud Build** | Builds Docker containers in the cloud | Takes your code and packages it — you don't need Docker on your computer |
| **Secret Manager** | Stores passwords and API keys securely | Holds your VirusTotal API key so it's encrypted, not in plain text |
| **Security Command Center** | Google's vulnerability scanner | The `get_scc_findings` tool queries this to find misconfigurations |
| **Cloud Logging** | Stores audit logs for everything in your GCP project | The `query_cloud_logging` tool searches IAM changes, compute events, etc. |
| **Vertex AI** | Google's AI platform (Gemini) | The `vertex_ai_investigate` tool uses Gemini to analyze security findings |
| **Chronicle API** | Google SecOps (your SIEM) | The UDM search, detections, Data Tables, and rule management tools all use this |

Turn them all on with one command:

```bash
gcloud services enable \
    run.googleapis.com \
    cloudbuild.googleapis.com \
    secretmanager.googleapis.com \
    securitycenter.googleapis.com \
    logging.googleapis.com \
    aiplatform.googleapis.com \
    chronicle.googleapis.com
```

**What happens:** Google turns on each service. You'll see "Operation finished successfully" for each one. Takes about 30 seconds total.

**If you see "PERMISSION_DENIED":** You're not a Project Owner or Editor. Either:
- Ask your GCP admin to grant you the **Editor** role on the project
- Or ask them to run this command for you

---

## Step 4: Create a Service Account

Your server needs an identity to talk to Google's APIs. In Google Cloud, that identity is called a "service account." Think of it as a username and password that belongs to the server, not to you.

### Create it:

```bash
gcloud iam service-accounts create native-mcp-sa \
    --display-name="MCP Server Service Account"
```

**If you see "already exists":** That's fine. It was created before. Keep going.

### Give it permissions:

Now we tell Google what this service account is allowed to do. We're giving it **read-only** access to your security tools — it can look at data but can't change anything.

```bash
PROJECT_ID=$(gcloud config get-value project)
SA_EMAIL="native-mcp-sa@${PROJECT_ID}.iam.gserviceaccount.com"

# Permission to read SecOps data (UDM search, detections, rules)
gcloud projects add-iam-policy-binding $PROJECT_ID \
    --member="serviceAccount:${SA_EMAIL}" \
    --role="roles/chronicle.viewer" --quiet

# Permission to read Security Command Center findings
gcloud projects add-iam-policy-binding $PROJECT_ID \
    --member="serviceAccount:${SA_EMAIL}" \
    --role="roles/securitycenter.findingsViewer" --quiet

# Permission to read Cloud Logging entries
gcloud projects add-iam-policy-binding $PROJECT_ID \
    --member="serviceAccount:${SA_EMAIL}" \
    --role="roles/logging.viewer" --quiet

# Permission to use Vertex AI (Gemini)
gcloud projects add-iam-policy-binding $PROJECT_ID \
    --member="serviceAccount:${SA_EMAIL}" \
    --role="roles/aiplatform.user" --quiet
```

**What each permission does:**

| Permission | English Translation |
|---|---|
| `chronicle.viewer` | "You can search the SIEM and read detections, but you can't create or delete rules" |
| `securitycenter.findingsViewer` | "You can see vulnerabilities, but you can't dismiss or modify them" |
| `logging.viewer` | "You can read audit logs, but you can't delete them" |
| `aiplatform.user` | "You can ask Gemini questions, but you can't deploy models" |

---

## Step 5: Add Your VirusTotal API Key (Optional But Recommended)

This lets the server look up IPs, domains, and file hashes in VirusTotal. **Skip this step if you don't have a VT account.**

### Get a free VirusTotal API key:

1. Go to **https://www.virustotal.com/gui/join-us**
2. Create an account (free)
3. Once logged in, click your avatar (top right) → **"API Key"**
4. Copy the long string of letters and numbers — that's your key

### Store it securely in Google Cloud:

```bash
echo -n "PASTE_YOUR_API_KEY_HERE" | gcloud secrets create gti-api-key \
    --data-file=- \
    --replication-policy="automatic"
```

**Replace `PASTE_YOUR_API_KEY_HERE`** with the actual key you just copied. Keep the quotes.

Now let the service account read the secret:

```bash
PROJECT_ID=$(gcloud config get-value project)
SA_EMAIL="native-mcp-sa@${PROJECT_ID}.iam.gserviceaccount.com"

gcloud secrets add-iam-policy-binding gti-api-key \
    --member="serviceAccount:${SA_EMAIL}" \
    --role="roles/secretmanager.secretAccessor" --quiet
```

**If you see "already exists":** The secret was created before. To update it with a new key:
```bash
echo -n "YOUR_NEW_KEY" | gcloud secrets versions add gti-api-key --data-file=-
```

---

## Step 6: Find Your SecOps Customer ID

Your MCP server needs to know which SecOps instance to connect to. That's identified by a "Customer ID."

### How to find it:

1. Open **Google SecOps** in your browser (the Chronicle console)
2. Click the **gear icon** (Settings) in the bottom-left
3. Click **"SIEM Settings"**
4. Look for **"Customer ID"** — it's a long string that looks like: `1d49deb2eaa7427ca1d1e78ccaa91c10`
5. **Copy it.** You'll paste it in the next step.

**Also note your region:**
- If your SecOps URL contains `us-chronicle` → your region is `us`
- If it contains `europe-chronicle` → your region is `europe`
- If it contains `asia-chronicle` → your region is `asia`

---

## Step 7: Build the Container

This is where Google takes your code and packages it into a Docker container. **This happens in Google's cloud — you don't need Docker installed on your computer.**

```bash
PROJECT_ID=$(gcloud config get-value project)

gcloud builds submit --tag gcr.io/${PROJECT_ID}/google-native-mcp:latest
```

**What happens:**
1. Google uploads your code files (~50KB — takes a few seconds)
2. Google reads the `Dockerfile` and installs all the Python packages
3. Google saves the finished container to your project's Container Registry

**This takes 2–5 minutes.** You'll see a lot of text scrolling by. That's normal. Wait for the final line:

```
DONE
```

**If you see an error about "Cloud Build API":** Go back to Step 3 and make sure you enabled `cloudbuild.googleapis.com`.

**If you see a Python error about "mcp" or "requirements":** The `requirements.txt` file might be out of date. This shouldn't happen with the latest code, but if it does, let me know.

---

## Step 8: Deploy to Cloud Run

This is the big moment. This command takes the container you just built and runs it on Google's servers, giving you a live URL.

```bash
PROJECT_ID=$(gcloud config get-value project)
SA_EMAIL="native-mcp-sa@${PROJECT_ID}.iam.gserviceaccount.com"
SECOPS_CUSTOMER_ID="PASTE_YOUR_CUSTOMER_ID_HERE"
SECOPS_REGION="us"

gcloud run deploy google-native-mcp \
    --image gcr.io/${PROJECT_ID}/google-native-mcp:latest \
    --region us-central1 \
    --service-account ${SA_EMAIL} \
    --no-allow-unauthenticated \
    --memory 512Mi \
    --cpu 1 \
    --min-instances 0 \
    --max-instances 10 \
    --timeout 120 \
    --set-env-vars="SECOPS_PROJECT_ID=${PROJECT_ID},SECOPS_CUSTOMER_ID=${SECOPS_CUSTOMER_ID},SECOPS_REGION=${SECOPS_REGION}" \
    --quiet
```

⚠️ **Before you paste this:** Replace `PASTE_YOUR_CUSTOMER_ID_HERE` with the Customer ID you copied in Step 6.

⚠️ **If your SecOps region isn't `us`:** Change `SECOPS_REGION="us"` to `"europe"` or `"asia"`.

**What each flag means (you don't need to change these):**

| Flag | What It Does |
|---|---|
| `--image` | Points to the container you built in Step 7 |
| `--region us-central1` | Runs the server in Google's Iowa data center (cheapest) |
| `--service-account` | Tells the server to use the identity you created in Step 4 |
| `--no-allow-unauthenticated` | Requires a valid token to access (security!) |
| `--memory 512Mi` | Gives the server 512MB of RAM (plenty for API proxying) |
| `--min-instances 0` | Server sleeps when no one is using it ($0 when idle!) |
| `--max-instances 10` | Caps at 10 copies if many people use it at once |
| `--timeout 120` | Allows requests to take up to 2 minutes (some SecOps queries are slow) |

**What happens:** Google creates your Cloud Run service and gives you a URL. You'll see:

```
Service [google-native-mcp] revision [google-native-mcp-00001-abc] has been deployed
Service URL: https://google-native-mcp-abc123-uc.a.run.app
```

🎉 **That URL is your MCP server.** Copy it. Save it. Bookmark it.

---

## Step 9: Add the VirusTotal Secret (If You Did Step 5)

If you stored a VT API key in Step 5, connect it to your running server:

```bash
gcloud run services update google-native-mcp \
    --region us-central1 \
    --set-secrets="GTI_API_KEY=gti-api-key:latest"
```

Skipped Step 5? Skip this step too.

---

## Step 10: Test It!

Let's make sure everything works.

```bash
SERVICE_URL=$(gcloud run services describe google-native-mcp \
    --region us-central1 \
    --format="value(status.url)")

curl -H "Authorization: Bearer $(gcloud auth print-identity-token)" \
    ${SERVICE_URL}/health
```

**What you should see:**

```json
{
    "status": "healthy",
    "server": "google-native-mcp",
    "version": "2.0.0",
    "tools": 22,
    "project": "secops-mcp",
    "region": "us",
    "integrations": {
        "gti": true,
        "o365": false,
        "okta": false,
        "azure_ad": false,
        "aws": false,
        "crowdstrike": false
    }
}
```

**What this means:**
- `"status": "healthy"` → ✅ Your server is running!
- `"tools": 22` → ✅ All 22 security tools are loaded
- `"gti": true` → ✅ VirusTotal integration is working (false if you skipped Step 5)
- `"o365": false` → That's fine — you haven't configured O365 integration yet
- Other `false` values → Also fine — those integrations are optional

### 🎉 IF YOU SEE "healthy" — CONGRATULATIONS. YOU'RE DONE.

Your autonomous security operations server is live on Google Cloud. It costs $0 when nobody is using it, and scales automatically when someone does.

---

## Step 11: Connect an AI to Your Server

Your server is running, but it's just sitting there waiting. You need to connect an AI client to actually use the 22 tools.

### Option A: Claude Code (If You Use Claude)

```bash
SERVICE_URL=$(gcloud run services describe google-native-mcp \
    --region us-central1 \
    --format="value(status.url)")

claude mcp add google-security --transport sse ${SERVICE_URL}/sse
```

Now every time you use Claude Code, it can access all 22 security tools.

### Option B: Any MCP-Compatible Client

Your server's endpoints:

| Endpoint | What It's For |
|---|---|
| `https://YOUR_URL/health` | Health check (test with curl) |
| `https://YOUR_URL/sse` | MCP client connection (SSE streaming) |

Every request needs an authorization header:
```
Authorization: Bearer YOUR_TOKEN
```

Get a token with:
```bash
gcloud auth print-identity-token
```

---

## How to See Your Server in the Google Cloud Console

Want to see your server in a web browser instead of the terminal?

1. Go to **https://console.cloud.google.com/run**
2. Make sure your project is selected at the top
3. You'll see `google-native-mcp` in the list
4. Click on it to see:
   - The URL
   - How many requests it's handling
   - Logs (what the server is doing)
   - Metrics (CPU, memory, response times)

---

## How to Update Your Server Later

If the code gets updated on GitHub:

```bash
cd ~/Desktop/Google-Native-MCP-Server    # or wherever you downloaded it
git pull                                   # get the latest code

PROJECT_ID=$(gcloud config get-value project)
gcloud builds submit --tag gcr.io/${PROJECT_ID}/google-native-mcp:latest
gcloud run deploy google-native-mcp \
    --image gcr.io/${PROJECT_ID}/google-native-mcp:latest \
    --region us-central1
```

That rebuilds the container and redeploys. Zero downtime — the old version keeps running until the new one is ready.

---

## How to Delete Everything (Clean Removal)

If you want to remove the server completely:

```bash
PROJECT_ID=$(gcloud config get-value project)

# Delete the Cloud Run service
gcloud run services delete google-native-mcp --region us-central1 --quiet

# Delete the service account
gcloud iam service-accounts delete native-mcp-sa@${PROJECT_ID}.iam.gserviceaccount.com --quiet

# Delete the VT API key secret (if you created one)
gcloud secrets delete gti-api-key --quiet
```

After this, nothing remains. No charges. No resources. Clean slate.

---

## Troubleshooting — When Things Go Wrong

### "gcloud: command not found"
You haven't installed the Google Cloud CLI. Go back to "Thing 3" at the top.

### "PERMISSION_DENIED" on anything
You don't have enough permissions on the GCP project. You need to be a **Project Owner** or **Editor**. Ask your admin to run:
```bash
gcloud projects add-iam-policy-binding YOUR_PROJECT \
    --member="user:YOUR_EMAIL" \
    --role="roles/editor"
```

### Cloud Build fails
Look at the error message. The most common cause is a Python dependency issue. Run this to see the build log:
```bash
gcloud builds list --limit=1
gcloud builds log $(gcloud builds list --limit=1 --format="value(id)")
```

### Health check returns "degraded"
The service account doesn't have the right permissions. Re-run the permission commands in Step 4.

### curl returns "403 Forbidden"
Your identity token expired (they last 1 hour). Get a fresh one:
```bash
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer $(gcloud auth print-identity-token)" ${SERVICE_URL}/health
```

### curl returns "Connection refused" or times out
The server might be sleeping (min-instances = 0). The first request takes 2–3 seconds to "wake up" the server. Try again — the second request will be fast.

### I changed my SecOps Customer ID and need to update
```bash
gcloud run services update google-native-mcp \
    --region us-central1 \
    --set-env-vars="SECOPS_CUSTOMER_ID=your-new-customer-id"
```

---

## The Speed Run (For People Who Don't Need Hand-Holding)

The entire deployment in one block:

```bash
# Setup
gcloud auth login
gcloud config set project YOUR_PROJECT_ID
git clone https://github.com/dnehoda-source/Google-Native-MCP-Server.git
cd Google-Native-MCP-Server

# Enable APIs
gcloud services enable run.googleapis.com cloudbuild.googleapis.com secretmanager.googleapis.com securitycenter.googleapis.com logging.googleapis.com aiplatform.googleapis.com chronicle.googleapis.com

# Service account
gcloud iam service-accounts create native-mcp-sa --display-name="MCP Server"
PROJECT_ID=$(gcloud config get-value project)
SA_EMAIL="native-mcp-sa@${PROJECT_ID}.iam.gserviceaccount.com"
for ROLE in roles/chronicle.viewer roles/securitycenter.findingsViewer roles/logging.viewer roles/aiplatform.user; do
    gcloud projects add-iam-policy-binding $PROJECT_ID --member="serviceAccount:${SA_EMAIL}" --role="$ROLE" --quiet
done

# Build + Deploy
gcloud builds submit --tag gcr.io/${PROJECT_ID}/google-native-mcp:latest
gcloud run deploy google-native-mcp --image gcr.io/${PROJECT_ID}/google-native-mcp:latest --region us-central1 --service-account ${SA_EMAIL} --no-allow-unauthenticated --memory 512Mi --set-env-vars="SECOPS_PROJECT_ID=${PROJECT_ID},SECOPS_CUSTOMER_ID=YOUR_CUSTOMER_ID,SECOPS_REGION=us" --quiet

# Test
SERVICE_URL=$(gcloud run services describe google-native-mcp --region us-central1 --format="value(status.url)")
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer $(gcloud auth print-identity-token)" ${SERVICE_URL}/health
```
